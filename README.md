# CS241_MIPS_Compiler

This is a school project made possible by University of Waterloo CS241 course

This project is a compiler that compile WLP4 (a simplified version of C code) to MIPS assembly
All the keywords & parsing rules & datatype & sample code recognized by this complier is in this following link
The language supports basic int datatype with +-*/ operationg, creating methods.
- https://student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~cs241/wlp4/

The source code will go through several step in order to generate the MIPS assembly code
- Lexical Analysis
- Parsing (Top-down or Button-up parsing all implemented)
- Semantic Analysis
- Code Generation

It will generates corresponding error messages in each step to notify what is wrong with the inputted code
